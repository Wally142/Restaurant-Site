 ## Requirements:

[X] Add Bootstrap to the site.

[X] Use a jumbotron or page header to call out big news - your restaurant is           opening a new location!

[X] Make the site responsive using Bootstrap's grid system.
    [X] The menu items should stack well, with no overlapping.
    [X] The front page content should stack as well.
    [X] Change the Home link to use the Glyphicon that looks like a house.

    [X] We're opening a new location!
    [X] We're rolling out our seasonal menu, with special options for this season.
    [X] The Drink of the Month is SG Special Brew.

[X] Make sure that users who have JavaScript disabled know that this site is best      viewed with JavaScript enabled.
